# bayesian-var-from-scratch
This repository provides a comprehensive tutorial implementation of Bayesian Vector Autoregressions following established econometric methodology. The tutorial covers the complete workflow from data simulation and likelihood function implementation to Minnesota prior construction and analytical posterior inference. Additionally, the repository includes a Gibbs Sampler + Metropolis-Hastings implementation that is validated against closed-form analytical expressions from Wozniak (2016), demonstrating the accuracy of MCMC methods for Bayesian VAR estimation. All code is written for educational clarity with extensive documentation, demonstrating how theoretical concepts translate into practical implementation. The repository includes comprehensive comparisons between OLS, analytical Bayesian, and MCMC estimates, making it ideal for students and researchers learning modern Bayesian econometric methods used in macroeconomic forecasting and policy analysis.
